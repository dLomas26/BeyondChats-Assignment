🧠 Overview
AI-Enhanced Admin Panel is a modern web application I developed using React and Tailwind CSS to streamline customer support operations. By integrating the Gemini API, I enabled AI-driven features like intelligent response suggestions, conversation summaries, and tone rephrasing—empowering support agents to work more efficiently.

The app features a sleek, responsive layout with an inbox sidebar, chat area, and AI Copilot panel—all designed with adjustable widths, independent scrolling, and a user-centric approach to enhance productivity.

This project showcases my ability to build scalable, AI-integrated applications with a focus on user experience, responsiveness, and practical functionality—skills I’m eager to bring to your team to solve real-world challenges.
